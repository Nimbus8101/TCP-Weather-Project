Project: TCP Weather Project

Descriptions:
    This project is part 1 of the project, and implements the following requirements:
     - User can register
     - User can login
     - User can change their password
     - User can subscribe to a location
     - User can unsubscribe from a location
     - User can view subscribed locations
     - User can logout

This project was built in the Windows Linux Subsystem, and compliles and runs fine on my machine. I was unable to run anything on the ssh server, due to denied permissions, and i couldn't figure out how to. So i included images of the terminal messages to demonstrate the functionality, which should also be visible in my code

- The tcpSserver.cpp contains code for starting and running the server, as well as has functions for each of the required functions, such as changing password or subscribing to a location.
- The serverUtils.cpp has some functions that are used in tcpServer.cpp, but in a seperate file to prevent clutter. Things like reading and writing to the users.txt file
- The tcpClient.cpp contains the code for starting and running the client.
- The user.cpp file keeps track of User variables during the session
- The utils.cpp file is for general utils, such as defining string and integer values for each option in the menu, making the code more readable
